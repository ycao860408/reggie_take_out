# reggie_take_out
This project is designed for a catering enterprice with the service of backend management and mobile application. The backend part enables
the company owner to manage employees, product category, products and keep track of the orders etc. On the other hand, the customers can use
the mobile application to brows all the dishes and setmeal and order their food on line and decide where their meals were delivered to (
transaction part is tempararily offline!) Since the product is an App oriented to the small restaurant, therefore, its QPS is not that large.
Therefore, we adopt a monolithic architecture for this system, shown as below.
